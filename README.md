# autovim

Permanently enable vim mode in CodeMirror elements like those in Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab.

I've published `autovim` to the Chrome extension store. It works perfectly as far as I have found with permanently visible `CodeMirror` elements, but is still flaky with `CodeMirror` elements that hide and show like those for Markdown in Jupyter.
